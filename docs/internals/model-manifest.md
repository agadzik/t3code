# Model manifest

The [bundled manifest](../../apps/server/src/provider/model-manifest.json) allows
offline startup; fetching it from `main` lets model metadata change between
releases. Failed fetches or invalid data preserve the last usable manifest.
Remote data must pass both catalog-reference validation and the owning provider's
adapter validation before replacing the cache.

A newer bundle outranks the cached remote manifest by `updatedAt`, so a release can
correct model data before the next successful fetch. Bump `updatedAt` whenever the
file changes. Fetch time cannot establish which copy contains the newer edit.

Generic catalog data describes presentation and capabilities. Each provider owns
its adapter schema and dispatch mappings. Adding a model with an existing
capability profile is a JSON edit; a new profile is needed only for a new
capability combination.

Model data is schema-validated configuration. Tests should cover resolver, cache,
and adapter semantics with synthetic model names, so adding a model never requires
tests that repeat the configuration.
